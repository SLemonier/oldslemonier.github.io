      <description>Recently, we had an issue with users complaining about applications crashing in their session. Mainly, it was about the web browser we updated a couple of days earlier, along with a VDA upgrade, and, at first, everyone was pointing it our direction.

 It&amp;rsquo;s always Citrix fault.
 But looking in Windows events, something strange came up.
The log was full of events ID 51 as below, talking about the disk issue.</description>
