      <description>If you’re not familiar with Chaos Engineering, let’s start with the definition:
Chaos engineering is the discipline of experimenting on a distributed system to build confidence in the system&amp;rsquo;s capability to withstand turbulent and unexpected conditions in production, according to Wikipedia.
It might sound pretty similar to &amp;ldquo;Disaster Recovery Plan&amp;rdquo; but it’s actually far from it. In such a situation, companies tend to test how they can restore quickly the service in case of a massive failure, like the loss of a data center or a building.</description>

      <title>Export and Import On-Prem Citrix Site configuration</title>

      <description>Disclaimer: as always, you should not run any script from someone you don&amp;rsquo;t know in your production environment, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re not able to understand every single line of code you execute. Run it in a safe (e.g. dev) environment first, run your tests and if it sounds ok, run another bunch of tests.
Recently, I had to update a Citrix Site from 7.15 to 1912 with a lot of catalogs, desktop groups and more than a hundred published apps (along with file type associations and so on).</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with Citrix ADC&amp;rsquo;s GSLB feature, let me summarize in a few words how this works and might help you with your deployment.
Let&amp;rsquo;s assume you are a medium/large company spread across the globe, with several datacentres (for this example, we&amp;rsquo;ll have one in New York and another one in London), and you want to offer the best user experience to your employees, partners or consultants when they work remotely (in this demo, I&amp;rsquo;ll use Citrix published apps and desktops but it can be adapted to any resources you might need to publish externally through your ADC).</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: before moving forward, I have to warn you: the following article is not entirely suitable for Public Cloud Providers. There are some specific parameters (such as the VM instance, Network Service Group and so on) that I am not able to test as I don&amp;rsquo;t have access to Public Clouds. You may follow this article but you&amp;rsquo;ll have to dig a bit when you&amp;rsquo;ll create your ProvScheme.

      <title>Provision new VMs in an MCS catalog with Powershell</title>

      <description>Introduction During a migration lasting several months and requiring to provision on a regular basis new VDI, I had to create several times a week new machines in two different MCS catalogs (one in each of our datacenters) in order to add them to the delivery group and have more.
It is actually not a &amp;ldquo;big deal&amp;rdquo; but each time I face a task I have to do several times a day, a week, a month, I try to automatize it in PowerShell, even if it is something that requires less than a minute to do so.</description>
