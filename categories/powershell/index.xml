      <description>Disclaimer: as always, you should not run any script from someone you don&amp;rsquo;t know in your production environment, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re not able to understand every single line of code you execute. Run it in a safe (e.g. dev) environment first, run your tests and if it sounds ok, run another bunch of tests.
Recently, I had to update a Citrix Site from 7.15 to 1912 with a lot of catalogs, desktop groups and more than a hundred published apps (along with file type associations and so on).</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: before moving forward, I have to warn you: the following article is not entirely suitable for Public Cloud Providers. There are some specific parameters (such as the VM instance, Network Service Group and so on) that I am not able to test as I don&amp;rsquo;t have access to Public Clouds. You may follow this article but you&amp;rsquo;ll have to dig a bit when you&amp;rsquo;ll create your ProvScheme.

      <description>Last month, well-known Citrix Expert James Rankin released the part 3 of his new series about Windows logon time optimizations. We are all aware of logon duration and how much it can be a pain to deal with in our environments, especially since Microsoft added more and more features to its operating system.
New versions continue to increase user logon duration and can raise up to one minute before letting users do their work.</description>

      <description>Introduction During a migration lasting several months and requiring to provision on a regular basis new VDI, I had to create several times a week new machines in two different MCS catalogs (one in each of our datacenters) in order to add them to the delivery group and have more.
It is actually not a &amp;ldquo;big deal&amp;rdquo; but each time I face a task I have to do several times a day, a week, a month, I try to automatize it in PowerShell, even if it is something that requires less than a minute to do so.</description>
