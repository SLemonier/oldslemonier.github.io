      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with Citrix ADC&amp;rsquo;s GSLB feature, let me summarize in a few words how this works and might help you with your deployment.
Let&amp;rsquo;s assume you are a medium/large company spread across the globe, with several datacentres (for this example, we&amp;rsquo;ll have one in New York and another one in London), and you want to offer the best user experience to your employees, partners or consultants when they work remotely (in this demo, I&amp;rsquo;ll use Citrix published apps and desktops but it can be adapted to any resources you might need to publish externally through your ADC).</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: before moving forward, I have to warn you: the following article is not entirely suitable for Public Cloud Providers. There are some specific parameters (such as the VM instance, Network Service Group and so on) that I am not able to test as I don&amp;rsquo;t have access to Public Clouds. You may follow this article but you&amp;rsquo;ll have to dig a bit when you&amp;rsquo;ll create your ProvScheme.

      <description>Introduction During a migration lasting several months and requiring to provision on a regular basis new VDI, I had to create several times a week new machines in two different MCS catalogs (one in each of our datacenters) in order to add them to the delivery group and have more.
It is actually not a &amp;ldquo;big deal&amp;rdquo; but each time I face a task I have to do several times a day, a week, a month, I try to automatize it in PowerShell, even if it is something that requires less than a minute to do so.</description>
