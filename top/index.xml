      <description>Hi!
My name is Steven, and I am currently a System Engineer, specialized in Citrix Technologies. I am a CCE-V for now 4 years, and I like to spend a lot of time working on ADC/ADM as well as on automation.
I am a co-Leader for the Swiss CUGC for about a year now.
I was recently introduced as a Citrix Technology Advocate (CTA)!
I have 10 yearsâ€™ experience with Citrix, which sounds not that much in comparison with my fellow specialists, but I always think we can learn from anyone, either he is a newbie in IT or a worldwide class expert.</description>
