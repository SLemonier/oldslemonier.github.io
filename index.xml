      <description>Note: I recommend you to read the following post but if you&amp;rsquo;re only interested by the script: here it is.
An introduction I always wanted to monitor correctly the end-user experience and especially application availability. Like, at any time of the day, can my business-critical resource be opened without any issue? And if there is, at which stage does it fail? Log on to the portal? Application enumeration? At the application launch?</description>

      <title>FSLogix profile container - Applications are crashing</title>

      <description>Recently, we had an issue with users complaining about applications crashing in their session. Mainly, it was about the web browser we updated a couple of days earlier, along with a VDA upgrade, and, at first, everyone was pointing it our direction.
You know it better than I:
 It&amp;rsquo;s always Citrix fault.
 But looking in Windows events, something strange came up.
The log was full of events ID 51 as below, talking about the disk issue.</description>

      <title>Export and Import On-Prem Citrix Site configuration</title>

      <description>Disclaimer: as always, you should not run any script from someone you don&amp;rsquo;t know in your production environment, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re not able to understand every single line of code you execute. Run it in a safe (e.g. dev) environment first, run your tests and if it sounds ok, run another bunch of tests.
Recently, I had to update a Citrix Site from 7.15 to 1912 with a lot of catalogs, desktop groups and more than a hundred published apps (along with file type associations and so on).</description>

      <title>Use monitors to leverage your GSLB setup</title>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with Citrix ADC&amp;rsquo;s GSLB feature, let me summarize in a few words how this works and might help you with your deployment.
Let&amp;rsquo;s assume you are a medium/large company spread across the globe, with several datacentres (for this example, we&amp;rsquo;ll have one in New York and another one in London), and you want to offer the best user experience to your employees, partners or consultants when they work remotely (in this demo, I&amp;rsquo;ll use Citrix published apps and desktops but it can be adapted to any resources you might need to publish externally through your ADC).</description>

      <title>How to create an (MCS) catalog in PowerShell</title>

      <description>Disclaimer: before moving forward, I have to warn you: the following article is not entirely suitable for Public Cloud Providers. There are some specific parameters (such as the VM instance, Network Service Group and so on) that I am not able to test as I don&amp;rsquo;t have access to Public Clouds. You may follow this article but you&amp;rsquo;ll have to dig a bit when you&amp;rsquo;ll create your ProvScheme.

      <title>James Rankin&#39;s first autologon automated</title>
      <link>https://stevenlemonier.fr/james-rankins-first-autologon-automated/</link>

      <description>Last month, well-known Citrix Expert James Rankin released the part 3 of his new series about Windows logon time optimizations. We are all aware of logon duration and how much it can be a pain to deal with in our environments, especially since Microsoft added more and more features to its operating system.
New versions continue to increase user logon duration and can raise up to one minute before letting users do their work.</description>

      <title>Provision new VMs in an MCS catalog with Powershell</title>

      <description>Introduction During a migration lasting several months and requiring to provision on a regular basis new VDI, I had to create several times a week new machines in two different MCS catalogs (one in each of our datacenters) in order to add them to the delivery group and have more.
It is actually not a &amp;ldquo;big deal&amp;rdquo; but each time I face a task I have to do several times a day, a week, a month, I try to automatize it in PowerShell, even if it is something that requires less than a minute to do so.</description>

      <description>Hi!
My name is Steven, and I am currently a System Engineer, specialized in Citrix Technologies. I am a CCE-V for now 4 years, and I like to spend a lot of time working on ADC/ADM as well as on automation.
I am a co-Leader for the Swiss CUGC for about a year now.
I was recently introduced as a Citrix Technology Advocate (CTA)!
I have 10 yearsâ€™ experience with Citrix, which sounds not that much in comparison with my fellow specialists, but I always think we can learn from anyone, either he is a newbie in IT or a worldwide class expert.</description>
